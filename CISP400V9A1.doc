A1.

Modify class GradeBook (Figs. 3.11–3.12) (attached) as follows:
a) Include a second private data member instructorName in the GradeBook class.  It represents the course instructor’s name.  The data type of the instructorName is a string.
b) Create a new setInstructorName function in the GradeBook class.  The function sets the instructor name.  It accepts a string argument and does not return anything. 
c) Create a new getInstructorName function in the GradeBook class.  The function retrieves the instructor name.  It does not accept any argument and returns one string data.
d) Modify the constructor to accept two parameters—one for the course name and one for the instructor’s name.
d) Modify member function displayMessage such that it will display the welcome message and course name, then outputs "This course is presented by: " followed by the instructor’s name.
e) Adjust all the necessary statements in the GradeBook.cpp file to display the required space(s) and line space(s).

This assignment comes with a CISP400V9A1.zip file.  It includes four files (CISP400V9A1.cpp, CISP400V9A1.exe, GradeBook.cpp, and GradeBook.h).  The CISP400V9A1.exe file is an executable file.  You can double click the file to get to the expecting result of this assignment. The GradeBook.h and GradeBook.cpp are bases for you for this program.  So, you don’t need to start from scratch but please remove all the non-related information for this assignment.  The CISP400V9A1.cpp is a driver program for you to test the required assignment implementation 

Put the GradeBook.h , GradeBook.cpp and CISP400V9A1.cpp(attached) file in a project you can compile the project and run to the following result. Please be awarded that you can adjust only your program(GradeBook.h , GradeBook.cpp) to generate the required result but not the code in CISP400V9A1.cpp file.

The following is the display of the expecting result.
 

Please document the files(CISP400V9A1.cpp, GradeBook.cpp, and GradeBook.h) properly and zip them into a proper named zip file for an assignment (refer to the assignment section of the class syllabus) and submit it to the A1 dropbox of the D2L Website.

AD1

Create an Employee class that includes three private data members— firstName (type string), lastName (type string), and monthlySalary (type int ).

It also includes several public member functions.
1.  A constructor initializes the three data members. 
2.  A setFirstName function accepts a string parameter and does not return any data. It sets the firstName.
3.  A getFirstName function does not accept any parameter and returns a string. It returns the firstName.
4. A setLastName function accepts a string parameter and does not return any data. It sets the lastName.
5. A getLastName function does not accept any parameter and returns a string. It returns the lastName.
6.  A setMonthlySalary function accepts an integer parameter and does not return any data. It sets the monthlySalary. If the monthly salary is less than or equal zero, set it to 1000 and it displays the employee’s first name, last name and the inputted salary with a statement “**==The salary is set to $1000.”
7. A getMonthlySalary function does not accept any parameter and returns an integer. It returns the monthlySalary. 
8. An increaseMonthlySalary function accepts an integer parameter and does not return any data. It increases the monthlySalary by integer%. The increase could be positive or negative. When this function is called the salary adjusted employee’s name and salary information will be displayed (please see the following image for details).

This assignment comes with a CISP400V9AD1.zip file.  It includes two files (CISP400V9AD1.cpp, and CISP400V9AD1.exe).  The CISP400V9AD1.exe file is an executable file.  You can double click the file to get to the expecting result of this assignment. The CISP400V9AD1.cpp is a driver program for you to use to test the implementation of this assignment.  You need to create and finish coding the Employee.h(Employee class declaration) and Employee.cpp (the implementation of Employee class) based on the above specification.

Put the Employee.h, Employee.cpp and the CISP400V9AD1.cpp (attached) in a project, you can compile the project and run to the following result. Please be awarded that you can adjust only your program to generate the required result but not the code in CISP400V9AD1.cpp file.

The following is the display of the expecting result.

 

Please document the files (CISP400V9AD1.cpp, Employee.cpp and Employee.h) properly and zip them into a proper named zip file for an advance assignment (refer to the assignment section of the class syllabus) and submit it to the A1 dropbox of the D2L Website.
